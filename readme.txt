QuickPop is handcrafted from scratch by the team at Brindle LLC. We're a small but mighty team of developers and designers who are truly interested in creating plugins that we would use ourselves. We focus primarily on re-envisioning common plugins that we found ourselves constantly looking for. You know the drill: You search for the same type of plugins, find a few, test them, and get disappointed. Not so with Brindle products since, well, we've been there, and we've now built them better.

== Other Notes ==

#### COMMON USES

<strong>Image Popup</strong>

The popup's content is setup very similar to a WordPress blog post, meaning you can edit text and add Media directly to the popup. This offers incredible flexibility while building your popup. 

<strong>Video Popup</strong>

Add a helpful tutorial that appears within a sleek popup, and supplement it with text to entice viewers to watch the video. Likewise, perhaps you simply want to share some news, a topical YouTube video, or your latest video creation that you just uploaded to Vimeo? With QuickPop, you can add a modal/lightbox based video in mere minutes.

<strong>Social Media Popup</strong>

Gain more social media follows by linking users to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other profiles. Place videos, images, and clickable social media icons to round out the design!

<strong>Subscription Popup</strong>

Collecting emails is huge, and QuickPop offers a unique manner in doing so. You can set your time delay to make the popup appear after a user has been on your site for an extended amount of time. Seeing as though they are clearly interested in your content, why not request that they signup for you newsletter via QuickPop's email opt-in feature? All submissions are collected in list view for easy reference and contact management.

<strong>Sale Promotions</strong>
Offer a discount to your shop with a promo code and link the customer directly to your product pages.

<strong>Cookie Notification Popup</strong>
Let users know that your site is tracking basic information via a cookie notification that must be agreed to in order to view your site.

#### What Customers Are Saying

<i>"This is one of the few companies I've seen that actually honors what they promise. The product is great and you can tell they put a lot of thought into it. I've tested so many popup plugins I can't even remember them all at this point, but QuickPop stands out. Not only is it as simple as possible to use, but when I requested support on a small issue I was having, they solved it within minutes! I'm not even exaggerating."</I> —Jason, QuickPop customer
